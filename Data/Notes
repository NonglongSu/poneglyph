#Do not call ensembl api from server because either: 
	1)-j divide it into 120 part (too many request)
	2)previous call block the current call and the server recognize it and block you.


#Ensembl cds excludes: nonsense mediated decay, retained intron.  
#Ensembl exon can be UTR only.
#Some exon are so big(>>10000bps).
#Different transcripts own their distinctive exons as the 5',3' UTR.
#Averagely, intron are much larger than exon. 


#The simple count of differences (the Hamming distance) between sequences will 
#often underestimate the number of substitution because of multiple hits (see homoplasy).
