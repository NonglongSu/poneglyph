#Do not call ensembl api from server because either: 
	1)-j divide it into numberofcores (too many request!!!)
	2)previous request can block the current call which forces the server recognize and block it.


#Ensembl cds excludes: nonsense mediated decay, retained intron.  
#Ensembl exon can be UTRs only.
#Some exons are so big (>>10000bps).
#Averagely, introns are much larger than exons. 


#The simple count of mismatches (the Hamming distance) between sequences will 
#often underestimate the number of substitutions because of multiple hits (see homoplasy).
