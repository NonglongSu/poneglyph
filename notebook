#Do not call ensembl api from server because either: 
	1)-j divide it into number_of_cores (too many request!!!)
	2)previous request can block the current call which forces the server to recognize and block.


#Ensembl cds excludes: nonsense mediated decay, retained intron.  
#Ensembl exons can be UTRs only.
#Ensembl API species name acronym: H.saps-P.tro 
#Ensembl genes have multiple version(transcripts) of transcripts. 
#Some exons are so big (>>10000bps).
#Averagely, introns are much larger than exons. 
#A cds can start from different exons.
#A cds can cannot have more than one exon containing the stop codon.
#On average, there are 8.8 exons and 7.8 introns per gene. About 80% of the exons on each chromosome are < 200 bp in length. 


#The simple count of mismatches (the Hamming distance) between sequences will often underestimate the number of substitutions because of multiple hits (see homoplasy). 

#The evolutionary models such as (JC69, K80) assume that different sites evolve independently and are identically distributed. But since we chose the cds so it might violate the neutral assumption.  

#The overlaps of more than one exon could be due to the exon excision&insertion in the past.
